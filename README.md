# IBL-Serotonin

## Instructions
Follow these instructions to set up an IBL environment which can load the data through the ONE interface: https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblenv. The data are not publicly available yet, you will need IBL access.

Make a python script called ``serotonin_paths.py`` in the root of the repository directory with the following content:

```
DATA_PATH = ''  # put the path to where the data is here
SAVE_PATH = ''  # put the path to where you want to save any results here
FIG_PATH = ''  # put the path to where you want to save figures here
```
